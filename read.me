Multimodal Visual Persuasion Analysis Agent 🧠👁️
This project utilizes Multimodal Large Language Models (GPT-4o) to simulate how different human personas perceive visual persuasion strategies in advertising.

By simulating diverse psychological profiles (e.g., "The Skeptic", "The Trendsetter"), the agent analyzes image pairs to determine which is more persuasive, provides detailed rationales, and estimates annotation difficulty.

📂 Project Structure
images_from_docx/: Stores images extracted from the source document.

results/: Stores the output CSV data and HTML visual reports.

run_fast.py: 🚀 Recommended. Uses parallel processing for high-speed analysis.

run_pvp_slow.py: 🐢 Stable Mode. Sequential processing with real-time visualization of the reasoning process.

Set env
Put you OPENAI_API_KEY in it.


🚀 How to Run
Step 1: Run the Experiment
You have two options for running the analysis.

⚡ Option A: High-Speed Mode (Recommended)
Use this script for the fastest results. It runs multiple analysis tasks in parallel.

Bash

python run_fast.py
Pros: Very fast (5x-10x speed). Uses a progress bar.

Cons: May hit rate limits on lower-tier OpenAI accounts.

Output: results/final_visual_report.html

🐢 Option B: Visual/Stable Mode
Use this script if you want to watch the model's "thought process" in real-time or if you encounter Rate Limit errors with the fast script.

Bash

python run_pvp_slow.py
Pros: Fully Visual Process. It prints the persona, choice, and reasoning for every single step to the console as it happens. 100% stable (no crashes).

Cons: Slower (analyzes one by one).

Output: results/final_visual_report.html


📊 Viewing Results
After the script finishes, check the results/ folder:

CSV File (.csv): Contains the raw data, including difficulty rankings and full text rationales.

HTML Report (.html): Double-click this file to open it in your browser.

It visualizes Image A vs. Image B side-by-side.

It displays the choices and rationales for all 12 personas in a clear, readable format.

This effectively "opens the black box" of the model's decision-making.




🧠 Personas & Strategies
The project currently evaluates 9 Persuasion Strategies (e.g., Authority, Scarcity, Social Proof) across 12 Distinct Personas, including:

P1_Traditionalist: Values heritage and authority.

P3_Safety_Anxious: Risk-averse, dislikes scarcity.

P12_Jester: Values humor and entertainment.
